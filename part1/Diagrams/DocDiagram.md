# HBnB Technical Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the HBnB project, outlining the systemâ€™s architecture and design. It compiles the key diagrams generated during previous tasks, such as the high-level package diagram, class diagram for the business logic layer, and API interaction sequence diagrams. This technical document aims to guide the implementation phases and ensure a clear understanding of the system's structure and interactions. By consolidating these elements, it serves as a primary reference for developers and stakeholders throughout the development process.

## High-Level Architecture

### Package Diagram

The high-level architecture follows a layered approach, employing a **Facade Design Pattern**. The system is divided into three main layers:

1. **Frontend**: This layer handles user interactions, delivering API requests from the user to the backend and displaying the appropriate responses, such as accommodation listings and booking confirmations.
   
2. **Backend**: The core business logic resides in this layer. It processes requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and applies the necessary logic to manage the accommodation search and booking flow.
   
3. **Database**: The persistence layer stores all the data, such as accommodations, users, bookings, and other related entities. It retrieves and saves data based on API requests sent from the backend.

### Diagram:
(The diagram shows the interaction between these layers with the user triggering actions from the frontend, leading to various API calls to the backend and database.)

#### Notes:
- The use of the **Facade Pattern** simplifies interactions between the presentation and business logic layers, making the system more maintainable and modular.
- Each layer communicates directly only with the layer it is coupled with, ensuring separation of concerns.

## Business Logic Layer

### Class Diagram

The business logic of the application is encapsulated in well-defined entities, each representing a core domain of the system. The class diagram captures these entities, their attributes, and their relationships.

### Diagram:
(The diagram presents the various classes like `Users`, `Places`, `Countries`, `Cities`, `Amenities`, and `Reviews`, along with their respective attributes and relationships.)

#### Key Components:
- **Users**: Contains user-related information such as `ID`, `Name`, `Password`, and `UserType`. Each user is associated with a place and can leave reviews.
- **Places**: Represents accommodations, with attributes like `Name`, `Location`, `Price`, `Filters`, and relationships to cities, users, reviews, and amenities.
- **Cities and Countries**: Define geographical data linked to accommodations.
- **Amenities**: Attributes like `ID`, `Name`, and `Description` specify the available amenities for each place.
- **Reviews**: Stores feedback left by users, with ratings and comments associated with specific places and users.

#### Design Decisions:
- UUIDs are used for all entity IDs to ensure global uniqueness.
- Relationships are clearly defined between entities (e.g., users are linked to places, places are linked to cities, etc.), which simplifies database queries and improves data consistency.

## API Interaction Flow

### Sequence Diagram

The interaction between the user, frontend, backend, and database is captured through sequence diagrams, which provide a clear representation of API flows for key functionalities like searching for accommodations and booking them.

### Diagram:
(The diagram illustrates the sequential interaction for searching and booking accommodations. The user initiates a search from the frontend, which triggers a GET API request to the backend. The backend retrieves available accommodations from the database, returning them to the frontend for display. Upon selecting an accommodation, the frontend sends a POST request to book the selected accommodation, and the backend confirms the booking after verifying availability.)

#### Key Interactions:
- **Search for Accommodation**: The user initiates the search, triggering a GET request that returns available options from the database.
- **Booking Process**: Upon selection, a POST request is made to book the accommodation, with the backend ensuring availability before confirming the booking.

#### Design Rationale:
- API calls follow REST principles, ensuring a stateless, scalable, and easy-to-debug system.
- The separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and database makes it easier to maintain and extend the system.

## Conclusion

This technical document consolidates the high-level architecture, business logic, and API interactions for the HBnB project. The layered architecture, with its clear separation of concerns, and the use of the facade pattern simplifies the design and makes the system modular. The diagrams presented here provide a blueprint for the implementation phase, ensuring clarity and guidance for the development team throughout the project's lifecycle.
